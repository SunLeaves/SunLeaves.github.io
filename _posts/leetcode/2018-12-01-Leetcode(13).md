## Lemonade Change

编号：860

分类：Greedy

### 题目

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. 

Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills).

Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill.  You must provide the correct change to each customer, so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

Note that you don't have any change in hand at first.

Return true if and only if you can provide every customer with correct change.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [5,5,5,10,20]
Output: true
Explanation: 
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [5,5,10,10,20]
Output: false
Explanation: 
From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
For the last customer, we can't give change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
Since not every customer received correct change, the answer is false.
```

### AC代码

Language: C++

Runtime: 16ms

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool lemonadeChange(vector<int>& bills) {
        int size = bills.size();
        // 只有5和10能作为回款，记录数目
        int numOfFive = 0,
            numOfTen = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            bills[i] == 5 ? numOfFive++ : 0;
            bills[i] == 10 ? numOfTen++ : 0;
            // 计算每个顾客所需要的回款
            bills[i] -= 5;
            // 根据所需的回款以及目前拥有的金额选择不同策略
            if (bills[i] == 5) numOfFive--;
            else if (bills[i] == 15) {
                if (numOfTen > 0) {
                    numOfTen--;
                    numOfFive--;
                } else {
                    numOfFive -= 3;
                }
            }
            if (numOfFive < 0 || numOfTen < 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

### 解题思路

好像这是easy难度的题目，所以很简单。只需要在选择回款策略的时候做一个简单的判断即可。

**算法复杂度**

* 时间复杂度：O(n)
* 空间复杂度：O(1)
